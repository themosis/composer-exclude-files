## Usage

## Credits

This Composer plugin has been inspired by the [mcaskill/composer-plugin-exclude-files](https://github.com/mcaskill/composer-plugin-exclude-files) package. Solely difference is that the plugin provides a different structure to list the files to exclude.

The plugin is a working piece of the [Themosis framework](https://framework.themosis.com).
